Technical and Economic Feasibility Analysis of a Natural Gas Well
Overview
This project presents a comprehensive technical and economic feasibility analysis of the PEGASUS (DEVONIAN) Well No. 70279125, using historical production data to evaluate its performance and investment viability. The study integrates core reservoir and production engineering techniques to provide a holistic view of the asset.

Data Source
All historical production data was extracted directly from the Texas Railroad Commission website.

Methodologies Applied
The analysis employed a multifaceted approach, combining industry-standard techniques:

Decline Curve Analysis (DCA): Utilized an exponential model based on 84 months of historical production data to forecast future gas production and estimate the Estimated Ultimate Recovery (EUR).

Economic Evaluation: Performed a detailed financial assessment, including Net Present Value (NPV) calculation, to determine the project's profitability under defined economic parameters.

Nodal Analysis (IPR/VLP): Modeled Inflow Performance Relationship (IPR) and Vertical Lift Performance (VLP) curves to identify optimal production rates and diagnose operational constraints, such as liquid loading.

Key Findings
The analysis yielded critical insights into the well's performance:

Estimated Ultimate Recovery (EUR): The well's total EUR was calculated at 3,706,677.99 MCF.

Economic Viability: The project resulted in a negative Net Present Value (NPV) of -$5,404,187.80, indicating it is not economically viable under current assumptions.

Liquid Loading Impact: Nodal analysis identified a significant risk of liquid loading, which could lead to a 25% reduction in production.

Tools Used
Microsoft Excel: Utilized for data processing, Decline Curve Analysis (DCA) modeling, economic calculations (NPV, cash flow), Nodal Analysis, sensitivity analysis, and dynamic charting (e.g., Goal Seek, pivot tables, complex formulas).


Future Enhancements (Planned)
This project will be further enhanced with:

Python (Pandas, Matplotlib): Applied for data validation, additional analysis, and advanced visualization.

Detailed sensitivity analysis to explore the impact of key variables (gas price, OPEX, discount rate) on project economics, including a tornado chart.

Implementation and comparison of hyperbolic decline models (with b<1 constraint) against the exponential model.

Development of interactive dashboards using Python (e.g., Streamlit) for dynamic scenario analysis.

In-depth cash flow and payback period analysis.
